# Tasks: Add Gemini Analyzer

1.  Create a new service `GeminiAnalyzeService` to interact with the Gemini API.
2.  Add a new endpoint in the `api-importer-backend` to trigger the analysis.
3.  Update the `ImporterComponent` in the `api-importer` plugin to add a new input for the API URL and a button to trigger the analysis.
4.  Display the generated OpenAPI spec to the user with an option to download it.
5.  Add unit and integration tests for the new functionality.
