# Proposal: Add Gemini Analyzer for OpenAPI Spec Generation

This proposal outlines the addition of a new feature that leverages the Gemini API to generate recommended OpenAPI 3.0 specifications from a given API endpoint.

The user will provide a URL to an API, and the system will analyze it and produce a downloadable OpenAPI spec.
