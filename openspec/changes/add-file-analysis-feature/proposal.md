# Proposal: File Upload, Parsing, and Analysis Feature

This document proposes the addition of a new feature to allow users to upload files for parsing and analysis. The primary goal is to help developers determine API endpoint routes from their source files, aligning with the project's purpose.

The feature will consist of a new UI in the frontend for file uploads and a new backend service to handle the file processing and analysis, leveraging the integrated Gemini LLM to extract relevant information.
